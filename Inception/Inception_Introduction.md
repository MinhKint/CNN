# I. Version

### **1. Versions:**

- **Inception v1 (GoogLeNet):**
  - Architecture: 22 layers (including Inception modules). Uses 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 filters in the Inception module, and adds the Auxiliary Classifiers technique.
  - Computations (FLOPs): About 1.5 billion.
  - Number of parameters: About 5 million.
  - Application: Suitable for image recognition tasks with large datasets like ImageNet. Due to the Inception module structure, Inception-v1 can learn complex and diverse features from images while maintaining computational efficiency.

### 2. Other improvements and variants:

- **Inception v2:**
  - Architecture: Similar to Inception-v1 and uses techniques like Factorized Convolutions to improve training speed and stability.
  - Original paper: "Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision" (2015)

- **Inception v3:**
  - Architecture: Adds Batch Normalization for each layer and Label Smoothing to increase stability.
  - Original paper: "Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision" (2015)

- **Inception v4:**
  - Architecture: Clarifies the number of filters and input-output sizes from Inception v2 and v3. It uses techniques like Factorized Convolutions and adds new Inception blocks to improve performance and reduce the number of parameters. A notable feature of Inception v4 is the division of the Inception block into three different types: Inception-A, Inception-B, and Inception-C. Additionally, Inception v4 also includes Reduction-A and Reduction-B blocks to reduce the spatial size of the input. The difference between Inception v4 and Inception-ResNet is that it does not have shortcut connections like in ResNet models.

- **Inception-ResNet v1:**
  - Architecture: Inception-ResNet v1 combines Inception blocks with shortcut connections (residual connections) from ResNet. This helps the network learn more complex features and makes optimization easier. The architecture includes Inception-ResNet-A, Inception-ResNet-B, and Inception-ResNet-C blocks, along with Reduction blocks to reduce spatial size.

- **Inception-ResNet v2:**
  - Architecture: Inception-ResNet v2 is an improved version of Inception-ResNet v1 with minor structural changes to improve performance and accuracy. It still maintains the combination of Inception blocks and shortcut connections. This architecture includes Inception-ResNet-A, Inception-ResNet-B, and Inception-ResNet-C blocks, along with Reduction-A and Reduction-B blocks to reduce the spatial size of the input.

- **Xception (Extreme Inception):**
  - Architecture: It replaces traditional Inception blocks with Depthwise Separable Convolutions, reducing the number of parameters and increasing performance. This architecture uses separate convolution blocks, where one convolution is applied separately on each input channel and then a pointwise convolution is used to combine the channels.

- Address overfitting issues: By significantly reducing the number of parameters compared to previous models, the goal is to minimize overfitting issues, especially in situations with limited labeled data.
- Integrate multi-scale processing: The research aims to integrate multi-scale processing into the network to better capture image information at different scales, inspired by both biological systems and theoretical insights from previous studies.

### **2. Research results:**

- Advanced performance: GoogLeNet, the implementation of Inception v1, achieved advanced results in ILSVRC14, winning the classification and detection challenges. It was particularly noted for using 12 times fewer parameters than the winning architecture of Krizhevsky et al. from 2012, while being much more accurate.
- Innovative architecture: The Inception architecture introduced a new module that allows combining multiple convolution filters (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) and pooling operations in the same layer. This module is crucial in effectively increasing both the depth and width of the network.
- Size reduction: The use of 1x1 convolutions to reduce size before applying more expensive convolutions (3x3, 5x5) proved effective in managing computational cost while maintaining high performance.
- Improved resource utilization: The architecture demonstrated superior resource management capabilities, allowing deeper and wider networks without incurring prohibitive computational costs. This led to networks that are not only high-performing but also feasible for practical applications.

### **3. Conclusion:**

This was achieved through careful architectural design choices, such as the introduction of the Inception module and the use of 1x1 convolutions to reduce size.
- Scalability: The design principles of the Inception architecture, such as multi-scale processing and size reduction, provided a scalable approach to building deep neural networks. This scalability is reflected in the ability to increase the size and complexity of the network without increasing the corresponding computational cost.
- Practical applicability: Considering computational efficiency and resource utilization during design ensures that the resulting networks are not only suitable for academic research but also practical for real-world applications, including mobile and embedded computing.
- Future direction: The success of the Inception architecture highlighted the potential for further research on optimizing network architecture through sparse structures and efficient resource management. It also suggests that future advancements may continue to draw inspiration from biological systems and theoretical principles to improve neural network design.
